# stocks-profit-or-loss

The program is built using Vanilla JS, HTML and CSS.

The site asks for the initial purchased price of stock, quantity of stocks purchased, and the current market price of stock.
The program gives the profit or loss amount and the percentage profit or loss.

I build this project as a part of a slew of projects in Neog.camp level zero curriculum. The program offers minimum hand holding and the available materials are enough to help whenever need arises.

Please visit my portfolio site for other such projects, I'll really appreciate and thank you for your time.
